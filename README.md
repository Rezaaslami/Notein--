# Notes App
https://rezaaslami.github.io/Notein--/ 

A simple and interactive web-based Notes App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, and it automatically saves all notes in the browser's localStorage — so your notes remain even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Create notes:** Click the "Create" button to add a new note.
- **Edit notes:** Click on any note and start typing. Content is editable directly.
- **Delete notes:** Click the trash icon to delete a note.
- **Auto-save:** All notes are saved automatically in `localStorage` as you type.
- **Persistence:** Notes are restored from localStorage when the page reloads.
- **Prevent new lines:** The Enter key is disabled to avoid accidental new lines.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Browser LocalStorage

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Click the **Create** button to add a new note.
3. Type inside the note to edit.
4. Click the **trash icon** to delete a note.
5. All changes are automatically saved.
